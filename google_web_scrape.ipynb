      "An all around excellent time. The food is great as are the portions. Tried the sausage appy, jambalaya and the brew house burger and all were very good. I had a slight apprehension that all the bbq sauce and onion rings would make the burger a stomach ache waiting to happen, but it was very well balanced with vegetables.We tried I believe 6 house beers and 2 non house beers between 2 flights and non disappointed, coming from someone who just starting into beer.The patio is pet friendly and both covered and heated which we loved as we came on a rainy night. You almost feel completely incorporated rather than separated from the restaurant which is fantastic.Our servers were all polite and kind, and knowledgeable with all the beers on tap which was appreciated. Service was great overall, even with menu questions.I seldom if ever give 5 stars and steamworks certainly earned each one of them.\n",
      "Dog friendly patio!! We brought 3 golden retrievers for brunch and they loved it! Lots of space under the table for them and big water bowls provided.The food and service is also really good!A great place to hang out for a couple hours and enjoy the sunshine!\n",
      "This is a cool new spot that opened recently under the Steamworks Brewing company - offers a very similar menu to that downtown.Happy hour offers a decent selection of food and a couple of beers. Lots of beers in bottles, including a massive 1.5L magnum bottle (probably the best value if you like sour style beers).The place does get very busy so getting attention from servers can be difficult but expected given the volume.Sitting on the patio is nice, except the heat is cranked! It gets really hot, wearing a T-shirt is actually a bad idea because your arms can get cooked!Otherwise, it’s a pleasant new hangout spot on Main Street.\n",
      "We stopped here for lunch as a group of 6, 3 adults and 3 children.Food: in a word - great. The menu is large and extensive. With plenty of healthy options as well as the usual options. I opted for poutine with the brisket which was brilliant. So so tasty.Beer: as a group with had 2x 4 flights + 1x 10 all with different beers and I can say with surety that they all tasted great.The wait staff were helpful and attentive. They were good with our children and the food was delivered promptly.Unfortunately we were on vacation so won’t get a chance to return for a while.\n",
      "The place is very new, clean, and spacious. Great for group gatherings. The Ahi tuna bites were very good but the classic pizza was just alright. The crust was very odd, it didn't taste like any pizza crust I have ever had. It was dense, hard, dry, and didn't taste like the dough was raised. The toppings were good but the pizza dough was definitely lacking.\n",
      "Bryan and his staff were so great and helpful in planning a large group (23 people) dinner for my husbands birthday this past weekend. Great communication, super responsive and really took the time to understand our group needs and set us up with the perfect space. Our server was fantastic and we never got any sort of sense of annoyance at being such a large group (which I have experienced from servers in the past). Amazing food and drinks and just all around great atmosphere! My first time here and will definitely be back.\n",
      "Great addition to Main Street, a locally owned and operated business that is one of the OGs in this city. Fun spot, phenomenal location in terms of Main Street, and an urban plaza nextdoor that makes it easy to chill.Fun ambience, nice vibes. Food was good. Smash burger was tasty, prices are expected with inflation. If we're getting specific, however, Steamworks, your bun sucks. It split down the middle, and was not desirable with a yummy burger falling apart.DJ was a nice Sunday addition, definitely managing this spot properly, my partner and I will be back.\n",
      "an excellent little taphouse in the heart of mount pleasant at main and 7th.the food is excellent. the beers have been cold and fresh.even in the busiest times the service has been great. lots of seats inside with an equally spacious patio.who can complain?\n",
